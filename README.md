This repository was created to document Fei Zibeng's learning and achievements in embedded development for the Internet of Things (IoT).
## Before anything else, you should have a good IoT (Internet of Things) development environment.
### [Let's use CLion and ESP-IDF for IoT development based on ESP32!](https://blog.csdn.net/wcc243588569/article/details/132805558)
- Clion24.1+espidf5.4
- also you can use a very good [plugin by yunyizhi](https://github.com/yunyizhi/ESP-IDF-for-Clion/releases)
